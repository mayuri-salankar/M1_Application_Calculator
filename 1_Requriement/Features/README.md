- **FEATURES:**

•	Addition : The addition (sum function) is used by choosing the "+" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.

•	Subtraction : The subtraction (diff function) is used by choosing the "-" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.

•	Multiplication : The multiplication (mul function) is used by choosing the "" operand using the keyboard. The function results in ab.

•	Division : The division (div function) is used by choosing the "/" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a/b.

•	Simple Interest : The simple interest (simple_interest function) is found by choosing "1". The function results in (ptr)/100. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest, t is number of time periods elapsed.

•	Compound Interest : The compound interest (compound_interest function) is found by choosing "2". The function results in p*(1+(r/100))^t. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest and t is number of time period.

•	Total Amount : The amount (total_amount function) is found by choosing "3". The function results in P+I. I is interest and P is principle

•	Natural Exponential : The natural exponential (e raised to the x) is used by choosing "1" which results e^x or exp(). The result is e (2.71828...) raised to x.

•	Logarithm : The logarithm (LOG) is used by choosing "2" which results LOG() where base is 10.

•	Factorial : The Factorial function is used by choosing "3" which results x!=x*(x-1)...2*1.

•	Raise to the Power : The raise to the power (y_raised_to_x function) is used by choosing "4" which results y^x.
