## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1.GCC erorr in windows and linux: installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.

2.Generation of makefile: To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.

3.Unity testing: Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.

## Functions 

FEATURES:

• Addition : The addition (sum function) is used by choosing the "+" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.

• Subtraction : The subtraction (diff function) is used by choosing the "-" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.

• Multiplication : The multiplication (mul function) is used by choosing the "" operand using the keyboard. The function results in ab.

• Division : The division (div function) is used by choosing the "/" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a/b.

• Simple Interest : The simple interest (simple_interest function) is found by choosing "1". The function results in (ptr)/100. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest, t is number of time periods elapsed.

• Compound Interest : The compound interest (compound_interest function) is found by choosing "2". The function results in p*(1+(r/100))^t. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest and t is number of time period.

• Total Amount : The amount (total_amount function) is found by choosing "3". The function results in P+I. I is interest and P is principle

• Natural Exponential : The natural exponential (e raised to the x) is used by choosing "1" which results e^x or exp(). The result is e (2.71828...) raised to x.

• Logarithm : The logarithm (LOG) is used by choosing "2" which results LOG() where base is 10.

• Factorial : The Factorial function is used by choosing "3" which results x!=x*(x-1)...2*1.

• Raise to the Power : The raise to the power (y_raised_to_x function) is used by choosing "4" which results y^x.
