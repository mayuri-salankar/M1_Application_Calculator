# REQURIEMENTS:

﻿- **INTRODUCTION:**

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, 
and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator.

﻿- **RESEARCH:**

The calculator has the following keys:  0 to 9, . , +, -, \*, /, ±, =, (reset) C, (clear) CE and 1-operand keys:  1/x, x^2 , square root.  In any situation the calculator has to produce a correct result defined by the well-known arithmetic rules.  If the calculation is impossible the calculator has to display information helping the user to resolve the erroneous situation like: 

• On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0" and typing the key “C” should reset the calculator. 

• On calculating the square root value of a negative operand the display should read "Wrong operand". 

• On erroneous operand or operation keys the display should read “Reset (C) to continue” or “Clear (CE) to continue” as appropriate. Of course, any situation can be cleared using the main reset key “C”.

﻿- **FEATURES:**

•	Addition : The addition (sum function) is used by choosing the "+" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.

•	Subtraction : The subtraction (diff function) is used by choosing the "-" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.

•	Multiplication : The multiplication (mul function) is used by choosing the "" operand using the keyboard. The function results in ab.

•	Division : The division (div function) is used by choosing the "/" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a/b.

•	Simple Interest : The simple interest (simple_interest function) is found by choosing "1". The function results in (ptr)/100. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest, t is number of time periods elapsed.

•	Compound Interest : The compound interest (compound_interest function) is found by choosing "2". The function results in p*(1+(r/100))^t. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest and t is number of time period.

•	Total Amount : The amount (total_amount function) is found by choosing "3". The function results in P+I. I is interest and P is principle

•	Natural Exponential : The natural exponential (e raised to the x) is used by choosing "1" which results e^x or exp(). The result is e (2.71828...) raised to x.

•	Logarithm : The logarithm (LOG) is used by choosing "2" which results LOG() where base is 10.

•	Factorial : The Factorial function is used by choosing "3" which results x!=x*(x-1)...2*1.

•	Raise to the Power : The raise to the power (y_raised_to_x function) is used by choosing "4" which results y^x.

﻿- **4W and 1H:**

__WHO:__
All the financial related employees and students can us this calculator to find out the result.

__WHAT:__
Calculator allows users to perform various arthemetic operations more easily.

__WHEN:__
To perform arthemetic operations with minimal human intervention.

__WHERE:__
It can be used in all domains. It can also easily implemented on the mobile systems and finance companies

__HOW:__
Calculators work by processing information in binary form. when you input numbers in to a calculator, the integrated circuit converts those numbers to binary strings of 0s and 1s. Once a calculation has been completed, the answer in binary form is then converted back to our normal base-ten system and displayed on the calculator's display screen.

﻿- **SWOT Analysis:**

**Strength:** 

• Calculator can Solve complicated problems quickly and in an effiient manner.

• It gives more accurate results than counting manually.

• Avoids boredom in counting process.

• Calculator  will be effiecient and fast in response.

**Weakness:** 

• Calculator limits the knowledge of users.

• Users will be so dependent on using calculators for counting.

• Relaying too much on calculator for counting can embarrass the users.

**Opportunities**: 

• General purpose calculators are those designed for specific markets.

• Basic calculators are affordable to most and they became common in schools

• Can be implemented on mobile devices with some advanced features.

**Threads:** 

• Loss of figure in computation of higer numbers.

• The processing of numbers are in binary coded decimal(BCD).
